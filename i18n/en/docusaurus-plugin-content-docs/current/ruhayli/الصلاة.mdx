Shortening the prayer for the traveler ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah benefit you. The questioner says: We came to perform Umrah and we will stay for a month. Is it permissible for us to take the travel license and shorten the prayers?

**A:** This is a matter of dispute among scholars. What is apparent to me is that you are travelers and you can shorten your prayer if you do not pray with the imam. As for the one who prays with the imam, he must complete it. And you can break your fast. This is more correct with me, and Allaah knows best

What should congregation say behind imam in Qunoot of Witr? ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah be good to you. The questioner says: What does the congregation say when they hear imam in the Witr qunoot glorifying Allaah and praising Him?

**A:** They should remain silent. They should not say, O Allaah, nor Glory be to You. And the imam's praise is also praise for the followers. If the congregation hears the imam praising Allaah, they listen to the praise of Allaah Almighty. And if there was something to be said, it would have been transmitted to us at the time of the Messenger of Allaah, may Allaahâ€™s prayers and peace be upon him, or at the time of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. And if the imam makes supplication, then the followers say "Ameen".

Is it better to complete the row or catch takbeer with imam? ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah be good to you. The questioner says: Is it better when establishing the prayer in the Prophetâ€™s Mosque to complete the first rows and fill in the spaces? Or hasten to say the takbeer with the imam?

**A:** It is better for you to advance until the rows are even and to fill the gap, even if you miss a rakâ€™ah. The reward is for you, praise be to Allaah. Because what prevented you from saying takbeer with the imam is a legal barrier, which is advancing and filling the ranks. And whoever is prevented by the legal impediment from a deed, the reward for that deed is written for him. By the grace of Allaah, you will be rewarded. The first reward: You go forward and straighten the ranks, and the Prophet, may Allaahâ€™s prayers and peace be upon him, said: Go forward and +!!!take care of me!!!+. And the second reward: the reward of catching the prayer from the beginning legislatively. But if there is a rakâ€™ah left and you fear missing the congregation, then enter with the row and pray with them, I mean the nearest row that you catch until you catch up with the congregation. The interest of catching the congregation here is higher than the interest of completing the rows, and Allaah knows best
