Shortening the prayer for the traveler 📃
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah benefit you. The questioner says: We came to perform Umrah and we will stay for a month. Is it permissible for us to take the travel license and shorten the prayers?

**A:** This is a matter of dispute among scholars. What is apparent to me is that you are travelers and you can shorten your prayer if you do not pray with the imam. As for the one who prays with the imam, he must complete it. And you can break your fast. This is more correct with me, and Allaah knows best

What should congregation say behind imam in Qunoot of Witr? 📃
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah be good to you. The questioner says: What does the congregation say when they hear imam in the Witr qunoot glorifying Allaah and praising Him?

**A:** They should remain silent. They should not say, O Allaah, nor Glory be to You. And the imam's praise is also praise for the followers. If the congregation hears the imam praising Allaah, they listen to the praise of Allaah Almighty. And if there was something to be said, it would have been transmitted to us at the time of the Messenger of Allaah, may Allaah’s prayers and peace be upon him, or at the time of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. And if the imam makes supplication, then the followers say "Ameen".

Is it better to complete the row or catch takbeer with imam? 📃
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah be good to you. The questioner says: Is it better when establishing the prayer in the Prophet’s Mosque to complete the first rows and fill in the spaces? Or hasten to say the takbeer with the imam?

**A:** It is better for you to advance until the rows are even and to fill the gap, even if you miss a rak’ah. The reward is for you, praise be to Allaah. Because what prevented you from saying takbeer with the imam is a legal barrier, which is advancing and filling the ranks. And whoever is prevented by the legal impediment from a deed, the reward for that deed is written for him. By the grace of Allaah, you will be rewarded. The first reward: You go forward and straighten the ranks, and the Prophet, may Allaah’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: Go forward and +!!!take care of me!!!+. And the second reward: the reward of catching the prayer from the beginning legislatively. But if there is a rak’ah left and you fear missing the congregation, then enter with the row and pray with them, I mean the nearest row that you catch until you catch up with the congregation. The interest of catching the congregation here is higher than the interest of completing the rows, and Allaah knows best

Praying in the row that has been cut off 📃
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. The questioner says which is better: praying in the first row that has been cut off or praying in the third row that has been connected.

**A:** Perhaps the questioner wants to be in this mosque now. Is it better to pray in the row next to the imam? Because now there is a row next to the imam on his right, or we pray in the rows behind. It is better to pray in the rows behind, because standing next to the imam without need is contrary to the Sunnah. He does not stand alongside the imam unless the one who is praying behind the imam does not find space behind the imam. As for standing alongside the imam with a place behind, this is contrary to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, may Allaah’s prayers and peace be upon him. And also because the one who stands in this row it is feared that he may step ahead of the imam. And whoever precedes the imam in prayer, even by a step, his prayer is invalidated according to the majority. It is the most correct of the sayings of the scholars. So praying in the back rows is better than the row next to the imam, yes

Praying Isha before its time 📃
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. The questioner says that in some western countries they pray Isha before the time by the Fiqh Council, so is it permissible for us to pray with them?

**A:** Degrees are not what's considered. Rather, what's considered is the legal signs. The legal sign of Isha prayer is the setting of the red twilight. It is not permissible for Muslims to pray Isha while they see the red twilight. The sign of the Maghrib prayer is sunset. When the sun sets, the time for Maghrib prayer begins. The point is not in degrees that contradict these legal signs. And in my theoretical study, It appeared to me that the degree in terms of pure sight in Europe is the twelfth degree. Some scholars see the fifteenth degree. The Fiqh Academy considers the seventeenth or eighteenth degree. But the legislative signs take presedence over all this talk. If the legal sign does not appear, then the Muslims in the country must agree on a time whether they take the degree decided by the Fiqh Council, or the old degree in Europe, which has many in the past, which is the fourteenth, or the twelfth degree, provided that this does not contradict the legal sign. And it does not lead to fitnah. Rather, they are keen to agree that they meet and agree on a time. It is not permissible, brothers, it is not permissible to violate the legal signs in favor of impressive sayings. And the strange fatwas that I heard these days are that a mufti issues fatwas that the countries in which the day is long in Ramadan but has night and day, but the day is long. He said they fast with the number of hours of fasting in Mecca. So he permitted them to break the fast, Allaah forbid, while they see the sun. This is undoubtedly a false statement. It is not permissible to take it or consider it, so what counts is the legal signs, in fasting from the true dawn until sunset. As long as the signs are visible, even if the day is long, then it is obligatory to sound and fine the sheep, because time rotates, and the fast may have been 3 hours. Rather, I was informed that in some regions, at times, fasting is 1/2 hour. So do we tell them to take also from the night as we told them to leave some of the day? There is no doubt that these sayings are invalid, and the legal sign is what counts. Perhaps we suffice with this. I ask Allaah Almighty to accept from me and from you and to make us all among His righteous servants, and Allaah knows best, and may Allaah’s blessings and peace be upon our Prophet
