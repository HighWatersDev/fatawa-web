Ruling on breaking fast in daytime of Ramadan when traveling ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: When is it permissible for us to break the fast if we want to travel during the day in Ramadan

**A:** Scholars differed regarding a Muslim who fasts at the beginning of the day and then travels during it. Does he break the fast? What appears to be the more correct opinion is that he may break the fast as long as he traveled during the day. And when does he start to break his fast? The majority of scholars, and it is more cautious, that he begins to break his fast if he leaves the urban areas of the city, and it is more cautious. Because a person does not know what will happen to him, he may break his fast, then he will stop traveling and miss the fast of that day. Some of the scholars are of the view that he breaks his fast even at home. It appears to be more correct that it is permissible for him to do so as long as he knows that he will leave the city during the day. But if he knows that he will not leave the urban areas of the city except at night, then it is not permissible for him to break his fast in his house. Because he will not travel during the day. I mean, brothers, a person at noon time wanted to travel to Makkah and his car was parked at the door. It is most likely that he will leave Medina much before sunset. It is permissible for him to break his fast while he is in his house before he goes out, even if this is contrary to what the majority of scholars say, because the evidence for it is established. But the more caution opinion is for a person not to break his fast until he leaves the urban area of his city, as we mentioned. As for a person who will travel before Maghrib and knows that he will not leave the borders of the city until the Maghrib prayer has arrived, then it is not permissible for him to break his fast at home because night will overtake him while he is in the city and he has not traveled. He does not have the right to break the fast while he is in his city

Virtue of finishing Qur'an multiple times in Ramadan ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** Peace be upon you, and may Islam and Muslims benefit you. The questioner says, may God protect you. Is it better to recite the Qurâ€™an a lot during this month, or to limit it to one or two recitations in recitation, contemplation and contemplation

**A:** The state of the predecessors indicates that the abundance of letters is better than the interpreted reading, which is with contemplation, but what appears, and God knows best, is that the matter differs according to different people in the view of the servant who is best for his heart, and what is more beneficial to the heart is better. And if it is possible to combine, such as making you an interpreted and deliberate conclusion from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, and making another reading for you in which you increase the letters, then this is good and perfect. For example, if you made the period between noon and afternoon, as much time as possible for you, in a contemplative reading that explained until the end of the month, and made you at the beginning of the day or at the end of it or at night a reading in which you multiply the letters.

Fasting in the country that doesn't rely on moon sighting ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah be good to you, bless you, and benefit Islam and Muslims. May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: If you are in a country that does not depend on the moon sighting, but rather depends on the astronomical calculation, and if the news of the moon sighting reaches them, they reject it if the calculation does not agree, then what should we do?

**A:** First, we must take the apparent meaning, so if the country depends on sighting, and they go out and see, and the officials in the country announce that the crescent has not been seen, then the people of the country take this. Shaban completes 30 days. What they did not say and they will not say, but if they said we saw the crescent, but it violates the calculation, so we do not take it. Here we take the view that they did not take, but this is what it is. But I say it as a scientific hypothesis. But if the country does not depend on the moon sighting in the first place, but rather depends on the astronomical calculation, and announces, perhaps a month or two in advance, that Ramadan is on such-and-such day. If it agrees with a legislation, even if it was not intended for its perpetrators, then it is considered to preserve the Muslimsâ€™ fast in general and the general principles of the Sharia. For example, it is announced that Ramadan is on so-and-so day through calculation and it agreed with people's of that country sighting of the crescent on that day. So they fasted on that day because of sighting. Here we say, O people of this country, fast, because this agreed with a legaslative aspect, which is the sighting in a Muslim country. Or it coincides with the completion of Shaâ€™ban 30 days, then they fast, even if this is according to astronomical calculations. But if it does not agree with a legislation, then they look to the nearest country to them, and they rely on what that country says. If one of them fears trial or harm, then he fasts or breaks his fast secretly, yes.
