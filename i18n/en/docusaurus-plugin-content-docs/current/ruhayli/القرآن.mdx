Ruling on swaying while reciting Qur'an ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: What is the ruling on swaying when reading the Qurâ€™an and scholarly texts?

**A:** Swaying is of two types: natural swaying, in human nature. It is from person's nature to sway. Some people even if they speak sway. There is nothing wrong with that. The fact that a person does not intentionally sway if he is reading the Qurâ€™an, he sways or moves back and forth while he is reading the Qurâ€™an. There is nothing wrong with that. And one does not ask a person to make an effort (to stop swaying) while reading when he is told to hold yourself. This distracts him from reading. The second type is intentional swaying. A person completes the recitation with it, so that the doer thinks that this is like recitation and beautifying the voice. He is worshipping Allaah with this swaying. This swaying has its origins in Sufism. The remembrance of Sufism is based on movement. And if you saw them remembering, you would have wondered whether they remember or play? They jump, jump, jump, jump, sit, rise, and crawl. And he comes to the sheikh and loves on the hand of the sheikh and comes back jumping and jumping and jumping then he comes and loves on the leg of the sheikh. Many of them want Allaah's face, but they don't know the way. Glory be to Allaah, sometimes the matter does not need knowledge, it only needs reason so that a person realizes that this is not right. For example, people come on the day of Arafah in the camp, and each one has a drum that is bigger than the other one's and they go "tun" "tun" "tun". And people get up and dance and dance and dance. And Allaah with reason does not need to know that this is not right. The Sufi remembrance is based on movement, and is mostly based on rhythm. He is a creative male. Better than the remembrance of Allaah, the Messenger of Allaah, may Allaah bless him and grant him peace. And after him, his companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. And what they were doing. This shaking as a way of worshiping has its origin in Sufism from the Sufi male. It is not permissible because it is a heresy. So we must differentiate, brothers, between normal vibration and that of human nature. Especially if he reads quickly. This is what he denies. And do not misunderstand him. And the intended vibration that brings him closer to Allaah. And we have the rule of origin in the believer if you see that you always think well of him. If the matter of a believer revolves between bad and good, then he is to blame him for good, unless evidence indicates otherwise. I mean, the matter revolved around a believer between being an unbeliever or not. Carry him not to disbelieve as much as you can to that way. Unless evidence indicates otherwise. Thus, if you see your brother reading while he is shaking, interpret it in a good manner, and that this is part of his nature and you get used to it, and he does not draw near to Allaah by means of it, so do not force him to be heresy. Yeah.
