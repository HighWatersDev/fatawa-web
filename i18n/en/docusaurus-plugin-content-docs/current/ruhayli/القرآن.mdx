Ruling on putting mushaf in one's pocket next to awrah üìÉ
</summary>

**Q:** May God be good to you, bless you, and benefit Islam and the Muslims. Questioner says: what is the ruling on placing mushaf in the pocket of one's garment next to the awrah.

**A:** Brothers, the general rule is that the believer must honor the Qur‚Äôan. And it is forbidden for him to insult it. Anything that is insulting to the Qur‚Äôan is forbidden. Among the actions that all rational people consider as an insult, then this is absolutely forbidden in all cases. Like, Allaah forbid, he puts the Mushaf on the ground and puts his toes on the edge of the Mushaf, the toes of his feet. Some people put the Qur‚Äôan on the ground and then stretch their legs so that they almost sit on the Mushaf. Every sane person understands that this is an insult. Likewise, for example, if the Mushaf is set up in front of him in a desk drawer or so, then he extends his legs to the Mushaf, and if I say to him, ‚ÄúMy brother, fear Allaah,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúWhat is the evidence?‚Äù And when you came, you raised your feet in his face, and he said, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, you have little shame?‚Äù Glory be to Allaah, when it comes to the book of Allaah [he says] "What is the proof?", but your face doesn't need evidence. Every sane person understands that it is an insult. As for the actions that people differ in, the reference goes back to the customs of the people. What your people used to consider as an insult to the Mushaf, it is not permissible for you to do it. This may vary from country to country. One of the virtues of our religion, brothers, is observing customs and keeping up with customs as long as it does not contradict Allaah's legislation. Some people think that righteousness requires fighting habit. Because habits, brothers, are linked to souls. Ibn Khaldun a well-known scholar says habit is a second nature. Habit becomes in the soul as if it were a nature, as if it were part of his nature, and there is no doubt about these brothers. Don't you see that the one who drives the car, if he rides in a car, behaves as if he is driving. If the car gets close to the signal, he might stretch his leg. Also, a person is accustomed, if he approaches his house, to take out the key. Sometimes you go to a person, if you approach the door, you take out the key. Habit is a second nature, so the link of the habit to the soul is strong. Therefore, one of the virtues of our religion is observing customs and keeping up with customs as long as it does not contradict the Sharia. Therefore, one of the principles of call to Islam and the principles of uprightness are to not contradict people's habits, as long as they are not contrary to the Sharia. Because if you violate the custom of people and it is not contrary to the legislation, they will hate righteousness through you. Many of the actions in terms of actions in the issue of the Mushaf are referred back to the custom. Because the legislation did not specify them, and the rule is that everything that was mentioned in the legislation in absolute sense and it's not restricted in the legislation or in the language, then it goes back to the custom. And putting the Mushaf in the side pocket if it was while sitting, then I see it and Allaah knows best as an insult because usually the pocket wraps around. But if it is in the state of standing, then it goes back to the custom of the people. Is this considered an insult or not? May Allaah help us and you to glorify Allaah‚Äôs religious signs and to honor the Qur‚Äôan.

Ruling on swaying while reciting Qur'an üìÉ
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: What is the ruling on swaying when reading the Qur‚Äôan and scholarly texts?

**A:** Swaying is of two types: natural swaying, in human nature. It is from person's nature to sway. Some people even if they speak sway. There is nothing wrong with that. The fact that a person does not intentionally sway if he is reading the Qur‚Äôan, he sways or moves back and forth while he is reading the Qur‚Äôan. There is nothing wrong with that. And one does not ask a person to make an effort (to stop swaying) while reading when he is told to hold yourself. This distracts him from reading. The second type is intentional swaying. A person completes the recitation with it, so that the doer thinks that this is like recitation and beautifying the voice. He is worshipping Allaah with this swaying. This swaying has its origins in Sufism. The remembrance of Sufism is based on movement. And if you saw them remembering, you would have wondered whether they remember or play? They jump, jump, jump, jump, sit, rise, and crawl. And he comes to the sheikh and loves on the hand of the sheikh and comes back jumping and jumping and jumping then he comes and loves on the leg of the sheikh. Many of them want Allaah's face, but they don't know the way. Glory be to Allaah, sometimes the matter does not need knowledge, it only needs reason so that a person realizes that this is not right. For example, people come on the day of Arafah in the camp, and each one has a drum that is bigger than the other one's and they go "tun" "tun" "tun". And people get up and dance and dance and dance. And Allaah with reason does not need to know that this is not right. The Sufi remembrance is based on movement, and is mostly based on rhythm. He is a creative male. Better than the remembrance of Allaah, the Messenger of Allaah, may Allaah bless him and grant him peace. And after him, his companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. And what they were doing. This shaking as a way of worshiping has its origin in Sufism from the Sufi male. It is not permissible because it is a heresy. So we must differentiate, brothers, between normal vibration and that of human nature. Especially if he reads quickly. This is what he denies. And do not misunderstand him. And the intended vibration that brings him closer to Allaah. And we have the rule of origin in the believer if you see that you always think well of him. If the matter of a believer revolves between bad and good, then he is to blame him for good, unless evidence indicates otherwise. I mean, the matter revolved around a believer between being an unbeliever or not. Carry him not to disbelieve as much as you can to that way. Unless evidence indicates otherwise. Thus, if you see your brother reading while he is shaking, interpret it in a good manner, and that this is part of his nature and you get used to it, and he does not draw near to Allaah by means of it, so do not force him to be heresy. Yeah.
