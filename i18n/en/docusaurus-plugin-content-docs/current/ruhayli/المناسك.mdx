Ruling on selling Hajj lottery 📃
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: If his name appears as a person in the lottery for Hajj, then he wants to sell that for a double amount, will that suffice him? Or may he?

**A:** If he did not perform the obligatory Hajj, then it is not permissible for him to offer someone else over himself, neither with compensation nor without compensation, as long as his name has come up and he is able to perform the Hajj, then he must perform the Hajj. He does not offer it to anyone not even his father. For there is no preferring others over oneself when it comes to personal obligatory duty. But if he had performed Hajj or had a problem that prevented him from performing Hajj, such as illness, poverty, or something else. Is it permissible for him to sell his name to someone else? Answer: If there is a lie in that, then it is not permissible. And if this violates the regulations, whether in his country or in the country issuing the visa, which is Saudi Arabia. This is not permissible. As for me, I do not know the situation if there was no lying, rather he relinquishes his name to the name of this one and does not violate these regulations, so there is nothing wrong with him taking compensation for this.

Performing Umrah twice in one trip 📃
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. The questioner says, “I left my country and intended to perform ‘Umrah in Sha’ban, and I sat in Makkah for two days, then I came to Madinah. So is it prescribed for me to perform ‘Umrah again?”

**A:** Yeah. As long as you have come to Medina to visit the mosque of the Prophet, may Allaah bless him and grant him peace. You may return to Makkah to perform Umrah on your behalf or on behalf of someone else for whom you may perform Umrah. There is nothing wrong with that, yes.
