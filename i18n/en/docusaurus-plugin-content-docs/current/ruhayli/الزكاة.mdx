Ruling on making stipulations in how zakaah is spent - 1 ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: Is it permissible for me to stipulate that those to whom I give zakat must spend it on paying off their debts?

**A:** No. You give them for a reason for which they deserve zakat, and do not prohibit them. Who gave you jurisdiction over them? Until you say to him: Take this zakat and buy oil and rice with it. I am not in charge of it. You must give him zakat. As long as he is sane and not interdicted, he acts in it. yes

**Q:** May Allaah reward you. He says in the sequel to the question: Is it permissible, if I have lent them money, to omit it from the zakat?

**A:** No. Zakat, brothers, must be paid and taken. It is taken from the rich and returned to the poor. Dropping the debt is not taking nor responding. So, brothers, in other words, zakat is an action, and forgiving the debt is abandonment. Forgiving debt is not zakat. On the other hand, by this you are in fact protecting your money in the name of zakat, instead of paying zakat to those who deserve it, you are preserving your rights. This is not valid in zakat, yes.
