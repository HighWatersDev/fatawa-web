Kissing elderly woman who is not mahram (forbidden for marriage) ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:** Questioner says: Should he kiss the head of the old woman who is not his mahram (forbidden to marry)?

**A:** The safest opinion is not to do that. As a precaution, he should not do that, neither shaking hands nor kissing the head, as long as he is not a mahram. And it is enough to give As-salaam to her.
