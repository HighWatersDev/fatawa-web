Completing rituals of Umrah while on menses ðŸ“ƒ
</summary>

**Q:**  A question, perhaps a woman says: I came from a far country, and before I arrived in Madinah, I had menstrual blood on the way. Is it permissible for me to perform the rituals of Umrah? How should that be done considering the specific date of return to the country?

**A:**  If you know from yourself that you will purify yourself before traveling at the time specified for the end of the journey, then when you reach the meeqaat with the company, you will purify yourself, you will perform ghusl and intend to perform the Umrah, and you will remain in a state of ihram until you purify yourself. Once you have purified yourself and performed ghusl, make Tawaaf around the Ka'bah and complete the actions of Umrah. But if you know you will not become pure except after the end of the journey, do not perform Umrah unless it is possible for someone to stay with you until the completion of the Umrah and then travel.
