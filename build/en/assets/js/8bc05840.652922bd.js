He, may Allaah\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, was blessed alive and dead, and nothing of his honor changed with his death, may Allaah\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him. Allaah decreed death for him like all other human beings. But his honor and grace remain. He is dead, may Allaah bless him and grant him peace, buried in his grave. And whoever comes to greet him must be display good manners with him May Allaah bless him and grant him peace. And the greatest etiquette is not to commit shirk while greeting the Prophet, may Allaah bless him and grant him peace. He does not say, O Messenger of Allaah, grant me wealth, O Messenger of Allaah, relieve my anxiety. Because if the Prophet, may Allaah\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, heard this while he was alive, he would have been very angry, because it is associating partners with Allaah Almighty. One of the great etiquettes is that the servant avoids innovations while greeting the Prophet, may Allaah\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him. And it is from good manners to avoid being in the form like the standing in prayer, because this standing is for Allaah and not for any of Allaah\u2019s creation. As if he puts the right hand on the left and lowers his head to the ground while greeting the Prophet, may Allaah\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, at his grave, bowing. All of this must be avoided. But a person stands while greeting the Prophet, may Allaah bless him and grant him peace, with manners. He does not appear here and there, nor does he shout and call, but he behaves with the Messenger of Allaah, may Allaah\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, while he is dead, as if he were meeting him while he was alive. It is bad manners that we see these days taking pictures at the grave, either to take pictures of the grave, or for a person to take pictures of himself at the grave. He comes with his back to the grave, then brings a camera and takes pictures with the grave. This is very bad manners with the Messenger of Allaah, may Allaah\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him.")),(0,n.kt)("details",null,(0,n.kt)("summary",{style:{fontWeight:"bold"}},"\ud83d\udcc3"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Q:")," "),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"A:")," ")),(0,n.kt)("details",null,(0,n.kt)("summary",{style:{fontWeight:"bold"}},"\ud83d\udcc3"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Q:")," "),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"A:")," ")),(0,n.kt)("details",null,(0,n.kt)("summary",{style:{fontWeight:"bold"}},"\ud83d\udcc3"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Q:")," "),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"A:")," ")),(0,n.kt)("hr",null))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
