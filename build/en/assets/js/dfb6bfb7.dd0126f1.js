Rather, what's considered is the legal signs. The legal sign of Isha prayer is the setting of the red twilight. It is not permissible for Muslims to pray Isha while they see the red twilight. The sign of the Maghrib prayer is sunset. When the sun sets, the time for Maghrib prayer begins. The point is not in degrees that contradict these legal signs. And in my theoretical study, It appeared to me that the degree in terms of pure sight in Europe is the twelfth degree. Some scholars see the fifteenth degree. The Fiqh Academy considers the seventeenth or eighteenth degree. But the legislative signs take presedence over all this talk. If the legal sign does not appear, then the Muslims in the country must agree on a time whether they take the degree decided by the Fiqh Council, or the old degree in Europe, which has many in the past, which is the fourteenth, or the twelfth degree, provided that this does not contradict the legal sign. And it does not lead to fitnah. Rather, they are keen to agree that they meet and agree on a time. It is not permissible, brothers, it is not permissible to violate the legal signs in favor of impressive sayings. And the strange fatwas that I heard these days are that a mufti issues fatwas that the countries in which the day is long in Ramadan but has night and day, but the day is long. He said they fast with the number of hours of fasting in Mecca. So he permitted them to break the fast, Allaah forbid, while they see the sun. This is undoubtedly a false statement. It is not permissible to take it or consider it, so what counts is the legal signs, in fasting from the true dawn until sunset. As long as the signs are visible, even if the day is long, then it is obligatory to sound and fine the sheep, because time rotates, and the fast may have been 3 hours. Rather, I was informed that in some regions, at times, fasting is 1/2 hour. So do we tell them to take also from the night as we told them to leave some of the day? There is no doubt that these sayings are invalid, and the legal sign is what counts. Perhaps we suffice with this.

Whoever advances to a place and he is entitled to it, then he has more right to it and has priority over it. And we said  "while he is entitled to it", what doesn\'t enter under that statement, for example, if a woman advances to the first row, she is not entitled to that place. It is for the one who came first. It is not permissible for anyone to abstract the place from the rest of the Muslims. It is not permissible for a person to stay in his house and send a prayer rug to be placed in the first row, and to eat and drink, and then come at the time of the call to prayer and walk through the people to the first row, praying on his prayer rug. This is injustice and aggression. In fact, he did not come first. Therefore, some scholars say the precedence is for bodies, not for prayer rugs. Bodies take precedence, not prayer rugs. And the Sheikh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, mentioned that removing these rugs is from prohibiting of evil. And praiseworthy command is what does not result in fitan and loud voices in the mosque. But whoever goes to a place and sits there, then gets up from it for a matter related to prayer or for a matter close, even if it is not related to prayer. He deserves his place. And he may place a prayer rug. And he may request to leave whoever sat in his place. Whoever gets up from his seat to return to it is more entitled to it. An example of this: A Muslim came to the first row after he had prayed Maghrib, for example, he came to the first row and sat before the call to prayer, and his ablution was invalidated. So he went out to perform ablution and came back. He went out for something related to prayer. This is for him to put down a prayer rug. And if he comes and finds someone in his place, he has to say, O my brother, this is my place, stand up. He deserves it. Or he went out, even if it was not a matter related to prayer, but something close. As if he went out to give his wife something. For example, a wife who broke her fast with him in the mosque, then she wanted to go home because of something that happened to her and the key was with him, so she called him, so he got up from his place to go out to her to give her the key. This is something that is not related to prayer, but it is a matter close to it, so he is more deserving of his spot. And Allaah knows. If a Muslim were to perform the Friday prayer early, he would sit in the first row before dawn, because he wants the first row. Then, after the sun had risen, he went out to do the Friday ablution, whether in his home or in the nearby places of ablution. He has a right to lay a prayer rug. Because he got up from his seat for something related to prayer, and he will return to it. He deserves it. But if his standing is for a matter not related to prayer, and it is prolonged, such as a lesson, for example, then he has no right to the place, and he should not put a carpet in its place. Rather, he should seek the reward and this is a matter of prioritising between good deeds. I hope that Allaah will write for him from His favor the reward for attending the lesson. And the reward for his prayer in the first row due to his intention, even though he was prevented from it by legislative reason. Yes')),(0,o.kt)("hr",null))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
