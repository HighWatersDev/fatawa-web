He makes the boy's left to the direction of the Kaaba, either by carrying him over his shoulders, or he is carried so that the boy's left is to the direction of the Kaaba.

As for the case of severe crowding, which causes severe hardship, for the father to make tawaaf twice, then he is excused from this, so if he carried him, it counts for both, Allaah willing, because the legislation does not bring difficulty or excessive hardship, but it is better to push him in a cart and not carry him. Brothers, if he pushes him in a cart, there is no problem, he puts him in a cart and pushes, no problem. But the problem is if he carries him in a crowded state, he will be excused from that, Allaah willing. One tawaaf is sufficient.
