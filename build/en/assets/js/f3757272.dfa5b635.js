These pills have harmful effects and lead to serious hormonal disorders. It may cause cancer and cause hair to appear in places where hair does not usually appear in women, and other damages. If a woman needs to take it, especially for the first time, then she should refer to the specialist doctor and conduct the necessary examinations. There is no doubt that continuing to take it harms women. It is not permissible for a Muslim to do what harms him. One of the perfections of our religion is that it forbids a person to do what harms him or others, as the Prophet, may Allaah\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, said: \u201cThere is neither harm nor reciprocation.\u201d She should not always take these pills according to people\u2019s advice, but rather refer to the doctor who conducts examinations and assesses the benefits and harms from a medical point of view, and does what the skilled doctor recommends. As for what this sister mentioned, that when she takes the pills, she finds drops of blood and she does not know whether it is menstruation or not. So we say that if her menstruation was at a known time of the month, then what happened at the time of menstruation is menstruation, even if she was taking pills, as long as it is at the time of her menstruation, then it is menstruation, even if it is a few drops. And if it was at a time other than her usual menstruation and it did not have the known characteristics of menstruation, then it is not menstruation. But if it has the characteristics of menstruation known, then it is menstruation. But if her cycle is disturbed and her menstruation does not have a specific time in the month, then she considers the characteristics. If its characteristics are the characteristics of menstruation, then it is menstruation. And if there are not characteristics of menstruation, then it is the corrupt blood, fatigue and exhaustion.

This was 50 years ago. They don\u2019t have sheep today. She regained from her intellect what was 50 years ago. And sometimes she enters and says \u201cMuhammad, how are you?"
