Rather, what's considered is the legal signs. The legal sign of Isha prayer is the setting of the red twilight. It is not permissible for Muslims to pray Isha while they see the red twilight. The sign of the Maghrib prayer is sunset. When the sun sets, the time for Maghrib prayer begins. The point is not in degrees that contradict these legal signs. And in my theoretical study, It appeared to me that the degree in terms of pure sight in Europe is the twelfth degree. Some scholars see the fifteenth degree. The Fiqh Academy considers the seventeenth or eighteenth degree. But the legislative signs take presedence over all this talk. If the legal sign does not appear, then the Muslims in the country must agree on a time whether they take the degree decided by the Fiqh Council, or the old degree in Europe, which has many in the past, which is the fourteenth, or the twelfth degree, provided that this does not contradict the legal sign. And it does not lead to fitnah. Rather, they are keen to agree that they meet and agree on a time. It is not permissible, brothers, it is not permissible to violate the legal signs in favor of impressive sayings. And the strange fatwas that I heard these days are that a mufti issues fatwas that the countries in which the day is long in Ramadan but has night and day, but the day is long. He said they fast with the number of hours of fasting in Mecca. So he permitted them to break the fast, Allaah forbid, while they see the sun. This is undoubtedly a false statement. It is not permissible to take it or consider it, so what counts is the legal signs, in fasting from the true dawn until sunset. As long as the signs are visible, even if the day is long, then it is obligatory to sound and fine the sheep, because time rotates, and the fast may have been 3 hours. Rather, I was informed that in some regions, at times, fasting is 1/2 hour. So do we tell them to take also from the night as we told them to leave some of the day? There is no doubt that these sayings are invalid, and the legal sign is what counts. Perhaps we suffice with this.
