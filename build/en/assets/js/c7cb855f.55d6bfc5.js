Does he break the fast? What appears to be the more correct opinion is that he may break the fast as long as he traveled during the day. And when does he start to break his fast? The majority of scholars, and it is more cautious, that he begins to break his fast if he leaves the urban areas of the city, and it is more cautious. Because a person does not know what will happen to him, he may break his fast, then he will stop traveling and miss the fast of that day. Some of the scholars are of the view that he breaks his fast even at home. It appears to be more correct that it is permissible for him to do so as long as he knows that he will leave the city during the day. But if he knows that he will not leave the urban areas of the city except at night, then it is not permissible for him to break his fast in his house. Because he will not travel during the day. I mean, brothers, a person at noon time wanted to travel to Makkah and his car was parked at the door. It is most likely that he will leave Medina much before sunset. It is permissible for him to break his fast while he is in his house before he goes out, even if this is contrary to what the majority of scholars say, because the evidence for it is established. But the more caution opinion is for a person not to break his fast until he leaves the urban area of his city, as we mentioned. As for a person who will travel before Maghrib and knows that he will not leave the borders of the city until the Maghrib prayer has arrived, then it is not permissible for him to break his fast at home because night will overtake him while he is in the city and he has not traveled.
