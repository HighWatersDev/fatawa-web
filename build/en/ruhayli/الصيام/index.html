traveling 📃</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p><strong>Q:</strong> May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: When is it permissible for us to break the fast if we want to travel during the day in Ramadan</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Scholars differed regarding a Muslim who fasts at the beginning of the day and then travels during it. Does he break the fast? What appears to be the more correct opinion is that he may break the fast as long as he traveled during the day. And when does he start to break his fast? The majority of scholars, and it is more cautious, that he begins to break his fast if he leaves the urban areas of the city, and it is more cautious. Because a person does not know what will happen to him, he may break his fast, then he will stop traveling and miss the fast of that day. Some of the scholars are of the view that he breaks his fast even at home. It appears to be more correct that it is permissible for him to do so as long as he knows that he will leave the city during the day. But if he knows that he will not leave the urban areas of the city except at night, then it is not permissible for him to break his fast in his house. Because he will not travel during the day. I mean, brothers, a person at noon time wanted to travel to Makkah and his car was parked at the door. It is most likely that he will leave Medina much before sunset. It is permissible for him to break his fast while he is in his house before he goes out, even if this is contrary to what the majority of scholars say, because the evidence for it is established. But the more caution opinion is for a person not to break his fast until he leaves the urban area of his city, as we mentioned. As for a person who will travel before Maghrib and knows that he will not leave the borders of the city until the Maghrib prayer has arrived, then it is not permissible for him to break his fast at home because night will overtake him while he is in the city and he has not traveled. He does not have the right to break the fast while he is in his city</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary style="font-weight:bold">Virtue of finishing Qur&#x27;an multiple times in Ramadan 📃</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p><strong>Q:</strong> Peace be upon you, and may Islam and Muslims benefit you. The questioner says, may God protect you. Is it better to recite the Qur’an a lot during this month, or to limit it to one or two recitations in recitation, contemplation and contemplation</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The state of the predecessors indicates that the abundance of letters is better than the interpreted reading, which is with contemplation, but what appears, and God knows best, is that the matter differs according to different people in the view of the servant who is best for his heart, and what is more beneficial to the heart is better. And if it is possible to combine, such as making you an interpreted and deliberate conclusion from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, and making another reading for you in which you increase the letters, then this is good and perfect. For example, if you made the period between noon and afternoon, as much time as possible for you, in a contemplative reading that explained until the end of the month, and made you at the beginning of the day or at the end of it or at night a reading in which you multiply the letters.</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary style="font-weight:bold">Fasting in the country that doesn&#x27;t rely on moon sighting 📃</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p><strong>Q:</strong> May Allaah be good to you, bless you, and benefit Islam and Muslims. May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: If you are in a country that does not depend on the moon sighting, but rather depends on the astronomical calculation, and if the news of the moon sighting reaches them, they reject it if the calculation does not agree, then what should we do?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> First, we must take the apparent meaning, so if the country depends on sighting, and they go out and see, and the officials in the country announce that the crescent has not been seen, then the people of the country take this. Shaban completes 30 days. What they did not say and they will not say, but if they said we saw the crescent, but it violates the calculation, so we do not take it. Here we take the view that they did not take, but this is what it is. But I say it as a scientific hypothesis. But if the country does not depend on the moon sighting in the first place, but rather depends on the astronomical calculation, and announces, perhaps a month or two in advance, that Ramadan is on such-and-such day. If it agrees with a legislation, even if it was not intended for its perpetrators, then it is considered to preserve the Muslims’ fast in general and the general principles of the Sharia. For example, it is announced that Ramadan is on so-and-so day through calculation and it agreed with people&#x27;s of that country sighting of the crescent on that day. So they fasted on that day because of sighting. Here we say, O people of this country, fast, because this agreed with a legaslative aspect, which is the sighting in a Muslim country. Or it coincides with the completion of Sha’ban 30 days, then they fast, even if this is according to astronomical calculations. But if it does not agree with a legislation, then they look to the nearest country to them, and they rely on what that country says. If one of them fears trial or harm, then he fasts or breaks his fast secretly, yes.</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary style="font-weight:bold">Ruling on drinking and eating at the time of adhaan 📃</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p><strong>Q:</strong> May Allaah bless you and bless you and benefit you from Islam and Muslims. May Allaah bless you, he says, he drank some water, thinking that dawn had not come. If he hears the iqama for prayer, what should he do?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> If he sees the dawn, it is obligatory for the Muslim who is fasting to refrain from eating and drinking, unless the drinking vessel is in his hand, in which case it is permissible for him to drink. A license from Allaah Almighty. And the sign of dawn is the call to prayer at the time. If the muezzin calls the call to prayer at the time known in the country, then as soon as the call to prayer is given, the Muslim must refrain from eating and drinking. The mere fact that the muezzin says Allaahu Akbar, the Muslim must refrain from eating and drinking, unless he has a container of water in his hand. The origin is that the night remains. It is permissible for a person to eat and drink until he knows that dawn has broken. If in doubt, the origin the night remains. Therefore, Ibn Abbas used to say, may Allaah be pleased with them both, eat and drink as long as in doubt. I mean, I am in the car going to Makkah, and I do not know the time of dawn in the area where I am in the desert. I may eat and I may drink. Because the basic principle is that the night remains .What is not permissible, my brothers, is what some of the brothers do inside Al-Madinah and say, “By Allaah, I was in doubt if it was dawn, so I eat and drink even if the muezzin called. If the muezzin called, then you know that dawn had broken.” Well, this brother of ours woke up and went to the refrigerator and drank water thinking that the muazzin did not call for prayer. ٍSo when he drank, the muezzin established the prayer. What is the ruling on fasting? The answer is that if he was not negligent and there was no sign of dawn, then his fast is valid. Because the principle is that the night remains. And his action was done in error. And Allaah Almighty, in the supplication of the believers, said, “Glory be to our Lord, do not blame us if we forget or err.” The Most Gracious, Glory be to Him, said, I have done. But if he was negligent, they had an alarm but he was negligent and indulgent, then he must make up that day, yes</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary style="font-weight:bold">Ruling on making up fasting when mistake in moon sighting occurred 📃</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p><strong>Q:</strong> May Allaah reward you, the questioner says: You said, may Allaah preserve you, that it is not permissible to fast today, the 30th of Sha’ban, as the 1st of Ramadan. While in reality, that day was from Ramadan and the moon sighting was after the 29th of Sha&#x27;baan. Is it obligatory on people to make up that day?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, if it was thought Shaban was 30 days and after we fasted for 28 days, we witnessed the crescent of Shawwal. This happened to us in our country years ago. If we see the crescent of Shawwal, we must break our fast. Although we have fasted 28 days. Because it is forbidden for us to fast on the day of Eid. Then we need to make up a day. Because the month is not less than 29 days, yes.</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary style="font-weight:bold">Ruling on accepting a witness of a woman in sighting crescent of Ramadan 📃</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p><strong>Q:</strong> May Allaah be good to you, bless you, and benefit you from Islam and the Muslims. More than one question says: &quot;May Allaah protect you. What is the correct opinion on accepting witness of a woman in moon sighting of Ramadan</p><p><strong>A:</strong> If a woman sees the crescent, then she considers seeing the crescent for herself, because she has seen the crescent. And there is a well-known difference of opinions regarding the issue of who saw the crescent and the sighting was not accepted. As for accepting the sighting from a woman for others, the disagreement is strong. What is mentioned in the Sunnah is the sighting of a man. Therefore, I refrain from speaking on the issue of obligating Muslims to fast based on sighting of a woman. Yes.</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary style="font-weight:bold">How should elder sick person feed poor for the days of Ramadan 📃</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p><strong>Q:</strong> May Allaah reward you.

It is permissible to feed for the whole month at the end of the month. As did Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him. As for feeding for the whole month at the beginning of the month, it is a matter of disagreement among the scholars.

The questioner says he has tests these days, and he takes thyroid medicine because he does not have a thyroid gland. He says, may Allaah protect you, and if he does not drink it, his head hurts very much, and he cannot test. So what does he do?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you are able to organize the medicine so that you take it at dawn, before the call to prayer, even if it is in a specific quantity, by referring to the doctor, then you must do that. As for just testing and some of them say fasting makes the mind weak or lazy. This is the opposite of scientific research. Scientific research has proven that fasting makes the mind sharp. However, the tests are not a reason for breaking the fast. And if the test conflicted with fasting, we would have said leave the study and fast, although it does not conflict. But Satan deceives people. And some muftis, may Allaah guide us and them, they tend to what pleases people. This means that some people manage to present as truth what would be a popular opinion with the people. This one, everything is forbidden with him. But if they see you as flexible, it means that you are determined according to people&#x27;s fluctuations. You will be popular with them. And Iblis is keen. Love of popularity is a disaster. And the love of people returning to man is a disaster. Man loves this. If he does not strive against himself by Allaah, he will neglect his religion even if he is a mufti. Some of the muftis, may Allaah guided us and them, I mean, tend to give fatwas to people as they like. And that they say to people if you are in a country where the day is long, fast with the number of hours in Mecca and break your fast even if it is noon. Mashallah. This sheikh. Or they say the students who are testing break their fast and make up. These fatwas are not based on a valid legal basis. We ask Allaah to help the muftis to do their duty, to fear Allaah, and to observe Allaah. We are all going to die. And we will all meet Allaah. And Allaah will hold us accountable, and there is not one of you who will not be spoken to by his Lord, without an interpreter between him and Him. He looks to his right and sees nothing but what he has put forth. And he looks to the left and he does not see anything except what he has put forth. And he looks in front of him and sees nothing but the Fire. We ask Allaah to protect us and you.</p></div></div></details><hr></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a
